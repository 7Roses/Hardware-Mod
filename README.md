# Hardware Mod

A Software Inc. modification that allows you to build Computer Hardware, including both Consumer and Servers.

## Hardware Components

The largest component of this modification, is a collection of "SoftwareTypes" that each represent a single component, and together allow you to create Computers.

Please see the list below for details on each type.

### Computers
**Computers** can be assembled out of parts either you or your competitors create, and don't necessarily make all the money; unless you're asking users to purchase your own Motherboard and Processor along with it.  The dependencies are not straight-forward yet, but selling a Computer with your own parts *will increase your Motherboard and Processor sales.*

#### Motherboard
**Motherboards** require an investment in time and resources, as well as a *new specialization:* **Physical Design** for your employees!  However, everyone needs a Motherboard to have a Computer, so it's an entirely new market of customers; if you can handle it.  The competition is very iterative, and will continue releasing "not so very different" versions; just like real life!

#### Processor
**Processors** required to make a Computer think, can also be created; and sometimes rely on features exposed by the Motherboard.  Some other components in a Computer may require certain features from the Processor as well at any given time, and customers do not generally buy Processors themselves (giving you a reason to make InHouse releases of these types.)

#### Storage
**Storage**, required to actually place data on a computer; and coming in a variety of balanced Stability, Usability and Innovative features that you can work towards.  Hard Drives can be purchased by individuals separate of a Computer purchase as well, but rarely.

### PCI Devices

These are additional components that can be added to a Computer that has either a PCI Interface or a PCI Express Interface on the Motherboard.  You will be given the option to add these components when building a "Computer".

#### Graphics Card
**Graphics Cards** , unlocked in 1992 with the introduction of the PCI Slot on your Motherboard; allow you to offload the processing of 3D Graphics onto a dedicated chip.  These are all the rave, and have a larger market than computers themselves; as customers might want to install two or three in their computers.
