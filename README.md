## Make your own Computers!
A mod for the game "Software Inc." which adds Computer Hardware.

- Computers are a collection of "Motherboard", "Processor" and optionally "Graphics Card".
- Motherboard has an extensive research and upgrade tree that you'll never be bored with!

**This modification is currently in an early testing version and may contain bugs.**

## Features
**Motherboards** require an investment in time and resources, as well as a *new specialization:* **Physical Design** for your employees!  However, everyone needs a Motherboard to have a Computer, so it's an entirely new market of customers; if you can handle it.  The competition is very iterative, and will continue releasing "not so very different" versions; just like real life!

**Processors** required to make a Computer think, can also be created; and sometimes rely on features exposed by the Motherboard.  Some other components in a Computer may require certain features from the Processor as well at any given time, and customers do not generally buy Processors themselves (giving you a reason to make InHouse releases of these types.)

**Computers** can be assembled out of parts either you or your competitors create, and don't necessarily make all the money; unless you're asking users to purchase your own Motherboard and Processor along with it.  The dependencies are not straight-forward yet, but selling a Computer with your own parts *will increase your Motherboard and Processor sales.*
